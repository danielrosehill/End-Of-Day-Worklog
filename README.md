# End-Of-Day Worklog

A personal productivity tool for capturing end-of-day work retrospectives via voice notes, processing them with AI, and delivering organized daily summaries.

## The Problem

Staying "in flow" by continuing to work is often the easiest way to remember what you're working on - but it's a poor organization system that leads to working longer than intended. There's a need for a simple way to "park" the workday, capture progress, and pick up smoothly the next morning.

## The Solution

A voice-driven workflow that:
1. Captures an end-of-day voice memo describing work progress and blockers
2. Processes the audio through Gemini multimodal AI
3. Generates an organized markdown/Google Doc with projects categorized by type
4. Delivers a "start-of-day brief" email the next morning with links to both the document and original audio

## Planning

This project is in early planning stages. Design notes and planning materials are available in the [planning/](planning/) folder:

- [SPEC.md](planning/SPEC.md) - Technical specification
- [notes.mp3](planning/notes.mp3) - Original voice note describing the project vision
- [Cleaned transcript](planning/gemini-multimodal-workflow-end-of-day-retrospective.md) - Edited transcript with filler words removed
- [Verbatim transcript](planning/end-of-day-retrospective-voice-note.md) - Raw transcript preserving original speech

## Status

**Phase:** Planning / Pre-development
