Okay, the purpose of this, um, audio context data, which I will run through my usual transcription workflow with MCP, uh, is to just update the, the planning notes, uh, that I really wanted to actually, uh, bring the project, uh, or, uh, execute upon this idea. Um, and I'll just describe exactly what I'm thinking of in this, uh, in this context data that I will then transcribe to notes, transcribe notes, and then do a spec, and then pass that to an AI agent. This is the, uh, this is the workflow. So basically, um, at the end of a work day, something that I struggle with, uh, sometimes I think is I might work, uh, longer than I would like to because it's the way that I stay on track. And I've realized for years that this is kind of a defective, there's something defective about the my, my organization system. And what would be massive for me, the reason I think that sometimes when I'm working on stuff is it's it's eas is the easiest way to remember what I'm up to, what I'm doing, what I'm, you know, it's like an organ, it's kind of an organization system in itself. But it's a bad one. So what would help me tremendously would be at the end of it, at the end of the work day, let's say 6:00 p.m., for an example, to make, to record a memo, a voice note just like I'm doing now, and note basically, um, where everything is up to. So usually in the course of a work day, I'm working on a couple of things, today, uh, administrative things, tax returns, um, and maybe a couple of projects, maybe a couple of work related, maybe one open source. And at a certain point I would just want to wrap up, I'm done, I'm done working on the computer for the day, you know, and I want to disconnect. Now, what I'd like to do in this voice note is just describe, uh, what I worked on today, how things moved forward, and what's blocking. So kind of a classic project management type thing where, you know, you go through progress, you go through blockers, etcetera. Uh, the kind of thing that I've seen definitely used in the past in workplaces, uh, with people who are into, you know, big into jury tracking and stuff like that. But in this would be a, um, this would be a workflow. So what I'm envisioning is as follows: recording that end of day, uh, note in some, somewhere that makes sense. Now what I'm doing currently is using Audacity. It doesn't make a lot of sense. It's not, not the best way to do it. So, probably I'd gravitate towards using my phone, um, as the mechanism or as the, as the thing to capture audio. And I think probably a web UI makes the most sense for many workflows including this one because you, you can do it at your computer, you can do it at your phone, so a responsive web UI. Um, and the workflow would be as follows, and I think this is actually just another, another perfect use case for Gemini multimodal because, um, because of everything that everything, all the reasons why this, uh, why it's so useful, because it allows you to put in audio and put in a prompt, and the prompt can be the fixed element, the system prompt. So the system prompt would be something like, this is an end-of-day retrospective by the user Daniel. Your task is to organize it into a, you know, organized document, um, with today's date, and, um, you know, organize information that he provided, projects, project by project, personal projects, business projects, open source projects, within those three top headings. Uh, maybe the, so those are the category headings, then the, then the individual projects mentioned. And finally within the projects level we'll have progress, blockers, you know, to-do tomorrow. So that would definitely work very, I I've no doubt that Gemini would have no problem with that. Gemini 3. Uh, a very capable model, big, big, big enough context window that it could output that all in one go in markdown. And the end of the pipeline, what I would like to get from this would probably be, um, a document, I would say probably Google Drive, uh, Google Drive doc, generated. So Gemini returns markdown. That gets created as a Google Doc, um, and then that gets sent. Now there's, uh, there's two ways I thought about using it. We could even have two formats, but to keep it simple, I guess just one, one format. Um, yeah, probably this makes similar sense, just to have a Google Drive structure where you have, um, end-of-day, I don't know, retrospectives, project flow, subfolders for a month, subfolders for day, um, and save it there. So you have like a proper folder structure that, um, that is time-based. And then in the morning, probably I guess as a best practice, is not to send you that after generation because the whole idea of this is to kind of park, park the work day. Um, and leave, you know, allow yourself to detach. So I don't think that would be helpful. Um, initially you can just a confirmation message maybe to, to, to validate that the pipeline's working. And then what would be very helpful would be the next morning, to have a, an email that sends to you at, let's say 9:00 a.m. saying, here is your start of day retre, here's your start of day brief, and it would link to the end of day brief. So in other words, on Monday I record my notes, Gemini gives me the kind of daily wrap-up, and then on Tuesday morning when I'm, when I'm back at the computer, it says, it sends me the generated doc saying, this is a capture of, um, of what you recorded yesterday, and then maybe a link to the voice note itself. Uh, for the voice note and in the pipeline, what I've come to realize is that compression. Uh, compression is your friend. Probably Opus, Opus mono, I think generally for these kind of things, it's always worth keeping the initi, the original voice data because the, sometimes, less, less happens a lot less nowadays, but sometimes the model gets it totally wrong and it's good to have your original, um, original audio there to refer to. So I think for the sake, for the sake of a a small amount of data, the pipeline would also include, um, that kind of downsampling step that I like to do in which the MP3 gets converted to mono, Opus, made as kind of lightweight as possible. In fact, that actually, that step should come in the, the pipeline before Gemini because that's the best practice I do anyway. Sometimes I do, uh, silence truncation as well. Uh, always the goal of not saving costs on Gemini, but, um, providing the cleanest input, so pre-processing. And that pre-processed audio is what could actually be saved into the, uh, into the, into the archive. So the folder could have, every daily folder has your end of day retrospective, the document, and it has the original audio, and the notification email that goes out to you the next day could have a link to the audio as well as the document. That's the workflow. I think probably this is again one of those, it's it's it's where I feel like there's so many useful AI tools like this and I just don't know, I'm still lacking the glue to put them together. Um, but until, until I have such glue or such a workspace, what I think would be, I think an N8N, I'm not sure they've ever gotten a voice note, um, together because that would be massive if they did. I'm sure they probably will eventually. Uh, so basically it just needs a record, it needs a form with a record button, um, and then a send button. That's all that, that's all that the actual UI has to be. Um, and then I could just bookmark that URL, send it in, and that starts the pipeline. Um, that's basically the plan. So I think N8N is the as the glue for the moment. Um, or maybe a Versel app that is authenticated. That could potentially work too. I'll have to think about the the best way to do these because it's it's again, it's less about the what'll work, but more, okay, if I want to have five or six of these very helpful daily utilities, they don't want to have a bunch of random N8N URLs. What's going to be the best way to create these things that I can kind of eventually have my like, you know, business admin panel, and I can just go into my end of day recorder and then do it there. That's really the long, that's the bigger picture thinking, I think, is how can I, um, bundle these very useful AI tools into some kind of environment. But for that, that decision can be deferred, uh, in the interest of getting a V1 of this, uh, working, and I will work on this soon.
