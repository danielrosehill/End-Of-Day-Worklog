# Gemini Multimodal Workflow: End-of-Day Retrospective

> The user proposes a system to record end-of-day retrospectives, transcribe them with Gemini, and generate daily summaries. The aim is to improve workflow organization and productivity by creating structured records of daily progress and tasks.

Okay, the purpose of this audio context data, which I will run through my usual transcription workflow with MCP, is to just update the planning notes that I really wanted to actually bring the project or execute upon this idea. And I'll just describe exactly what I'm thinking of in this context data that I will then transcribe to notes, transcribe notes and then do a spec, and then pass that to an AI agent. This is the workflow.

So basically, at the end of a workday—something that I struggle with—sometimes I think is I might work longer than I would like to, because it's the way that I stay on track. And I've realized for years that this kind of a defective, it's something defective about the my organization system. And what would be massive for me?

The reason I think that sometimes when I'm working on stuff is it's is the easiest way to remember what I'm up to, what I'm doing, what I'm, you know, it's like an or—it's kind of an organization system in itself, but it's a bad one.

So, what would help me tremendously would be at the end of a—at the end of the workday, let's say 6:00 p.m. for an example, to make, to record a memo, a voice note just like I'm doing now, and note basically where everything is up to. So usually in the course of a workday, I'm working on a couple of things: today, administrative things—tax returns—and maybe a couple of projects, maybe a couple work-related, maybe one open source. At a certain point I would just want to wrap up. I'm done. I'm done working on the computer for the day, you know, and I want to disconnect.

### Proposed Workflow

Now, what I'd like to do in this voice note is just describe what I worked on today, how things moved forward, and what's blocking. So kind of a classic project management type thing where, you know, you go through progress, you go through blockers, etc. The kind of thing that I've seen definitely used in the past in workplaces, with people who are into, you know, big into Jira tracking and stuff like that. But this would be a workflow. So what I'm envisioning is as follows: recording that end-of-day note in some—somewhere that makes sense. Now what I'm doing currently is using Audacity, it doesn't make a lot of sense. It's not not the best way to do it. So probably I'd gravitate towards using my phone as the mechanism or as the thing to capture audio.

And I think probably a web UI makes the most sense for many workflows including this one, because you you can do it at your computer, you can do it at your at your phones. A responsive web UI. And the workflow would be as follows, and I think this is actually just another another perfect use case for Gemini Multimodal, because because of everything that everything all the reasons why this, why it's so useful. Because it allows you to put in audio and put in a prompt, and the prompt can be the fixed element, a system prompt.

So the system prompt would be something like, "This is an end-of-day retrospective by the user Daniel. Your task is to organize it into a organized document with today's date, and organize information that he provided project by project, personal projects, business projects, open-source projects" within those three top headings. Maybe the—so those are the category headings—then the—then the individual projects mentioned, and finally within the projects level, we'll have progress, blockers, you know, to-do tomorrow.

So that would definitely work very—I have no doubt that Gemini would have no problem with that, Gemini 3. Very capable model, big—big enough context window that it could output that all in one go in Markdown. And the end of the pipeline, what I would like to get from this would probably be a document. I would say probably Google Drive. Google Drive Doc generated. So Gemini returns Markdown, that gets created as a Google Doc. And then that gets sent. Now there's—there's two ways I thought about using it. We could even have two formats, but to keep it simple I guess just one one format. Yeah, probably this makes the most sense: just to have a Google Drive structure where you have end-of-day, I don't know, retrospectives, project flow, subfolders for month, subfolders for day, and save it there. So you have like a proper folder structure that is time-based. And then, in the morning—probably, I guess is the best practice—is not to send you that after generation, because the whole idea of this is to kind of park park the workday. And leave, you know, allow yourself to detach. So I don't think that would be helpful. Initially, you can just a confirmation message maybe to to to validate that the pipeline's working.

And then what would be very helpful would be the next morning to have a an email that sends to you at, let's say, 9:00 a.m. saying, "Here's your start-of-day—here's your start-of-day brief." And it would link to the end-of-day brief. So in other words, on a Monday I record my notes, Gemini gives me the kind of daily wrap-up, and then on Tuesday morning when I'm when I'm back at the computer, it says—it sends me the generated doc saying, "This is a capture of what you recorded yesterday," and then maybe a link to the voice note itself. For the voice note in the pipeline, what I've come to realize is that compression. Compression is your friend.

Probably Opus, Opus mono—I think generally for these kind of things it's always worth keeping the the original voice data, because the sometimes less less happens a lot less nowadays, but sometimes the model gets it totally wrong and it's good to have your original original audio there to refer to. So I think for the sake for the sake of a a small amount of data, the pipeline would also include that kind of downsampling step that I like to do in which the MP3 gets converted to mono, Opus, made as kind of lightweight as possible. In fact, that actually that step should come in the pipeline before Gemini, because that's the best practice I do anyway.

Sometimes I do silence truncation as well. Always the goal of not saving cost on Gemini, but providing the cleanest input, so preprocessing. And that pre-processed audio is what could actually be saved into the into the into the archive. So the folder could have—every daily folder has your end-of-day retrospective, the document, and it has the original audio. And the notification email that goes out to you the next day could have a link to the audio as well as the document. That's the workflow. I think probably this is again one of those, it's it's it's where I feel like there's so many useful AI tools like this and I just don't know, I'm still lacking the glue to put them together. But until until I have such glue or such a workspace, what I think would be—I think an N8N—I'm not sure they've ever gotten a voice node together, because that would be massive if they did. I'm sure they probably will eventually.

So basically just needs a record—it needs a form with a record button and then a send button. That's all that that's all that the actual UI has to be. And then I could just bookmark that URL, send it in, and that starts the pipeline. That's basically the plan. So I think N8N is the is the glue for the moment. Or maybe a Vercel app that is authenticated. That could potentially work, too. I'll have to think about the the best way to do these, because it's it's again, it's less about the what'll work, but more, okay, if I want to have five or six of these very helpful daily utilities, I don't want to have a bunch of random N8N URLs.

What's going to be the best way to create these things that I can kind of eventually have my like, you know, business admin panel? And I can just go into my end-of-day recorder and then do it there. That's really the long—that's the bigger picture thinking, I think, is how can I bundle these very useful AI tools into some kind of environment? But for that that decision can be deferred in the interests of getting a v1 of this working. And I will work on this soon.
